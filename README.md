# Global Terrorism Analysis

## Overview

This project involves data analysis on the Global Terrorism Dataset, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze incident descriptions and classify terrorist organizations.

## Data Analysis

### Description

The analysis focuses on exploring and understanding patterns within the Global Terrorism Dataset, aiming to derive insights and trends related to terrorist incidents worldwide.

### Tools and Libraries

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the Global Terrorism Dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring key statistics, trends, and visualizing the data.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping incidents to understand geographical patterns.
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Analyzing trends over time.
5. **Statistical Insights**: Extracting statistical information to better understand the dataset.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Description

NLP techniques are applied to analyze the textual descriptions of each incident in the dataset. This involves extracting meaningful information and patterns from the unstructured text.

### Tools and Libraries

- BERT
- WordCloud

### NLP Steps

1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the incident descriptions.
2. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into tokens.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the sentiment of incident descriptions.
4. **WordCloud Visualization**: Visualizing the most frequent words in the dataset.

## Classification of Terrorist Organizations

### Description

Classification algorithms are employed to categorize and label terrorist organizations based on specific attributes or features.

### Tools and Libraries

- PyTorch

### Classification Steps

1. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying relevant features for classification.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing a suitable classification algorithm.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model and evaluating its performance.
4. **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzing the classification results.
